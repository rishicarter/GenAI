The vector is formed by overlaying a grid over the football field and counting the number of actions performed in each grid cell. However, a coarse grid may miss key variations between locations, and a finer-grained grid substantially increases data sparsity because then fewer actions happen in a single grid cell. The high-dimensional nature of the vector prevents immediate interpretation, making it challenging to separate certain traits from the generated vector. While player2vec alone may not detect a player's shot actions, it can still help in analysis by capturing both playing styles of teams and players, but more data and research are required to statistically prove its robustness. The vector's length of 32 dimensions makes it difficult for straightforward observation or comparison, necessitating the intervention of sports scientists to link the outcomes of real performance and the practical influence on players' play styles."

       "This thesis explores the application of reinforcement learning algorithms in football team selection and player replacement strategies. The study aims to address the challenges of team selection and player replacement in football, which are complex and multifaceted problems. The proposed approach involves the development of a decision-making framework that utilizes historical match data and machine learning techniques to predict the expected outcome of a match based on the selected team and the replacement of injured or suspended players. The framework is evaluated using real-world match data from the English Premier League, and the results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning algorithms in improving team selection and player replacement strategies in football. The study also highlights the importance of contextual information, such as team form, player fitness, and opposition analysis, in decision-making processes. Overall, this thesis contributes to the growing body of research in sports analytics and provides insights into the application of reinforcement learning algorithms in football team selection and player replacement strategies."
